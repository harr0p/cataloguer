# My Personal Project:

## Comic Book Indexer

The purpose of this application is to help as an organizer/indexer for my comic books that I possess, and for the ones that I want to obtain. It will be able
to categorize the comic (or book) by writer, illustrator, issue of comic, series of comic, and by age of comic (comics have been produced in different ages of time such as "bronze", "silver", and "gold").
There are many ways this code can be updated and used to help people organize or index their own comics or books. I want this application to be able to be used by a wide amount of people who are interested in organized their objects, I do not want it to be limited to people of a niche interest.
This project is of interest to me because I have tons of comics book which I have bought but I have yet to actually organize some of them, and it would help me out a lot if I had an index which I could just check to see which issues I am missing, which issues I haven't read yet.

To be more specific, the three requirements that I will begin with is:
- Input date and year, to organize by such times
- Be able to request and pull certain comics from a time frame or series
- Be able to rearrange comics by oldest to newest

In the context of an indexing application:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a comic book to my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a comic book from my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the titles of the comic books in my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to select a comic book from my collection

Phase 2 Updates:
- As a user, I want to be able to save and export my list of comic books in inventory
- As a user, I want to be able to load up a preexisting list of comic books into inventory

Phase 3 Updates:
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple Comic's to a ComicBin, where both are classes that you have designed as part of your application. My GUI must include a panel in which all the Comic's that have already been added to the ComicBin are displayed.  You are also required to implement two related events. I must include a button  that can be used to add a Comic to a ComicBin, and a menu item that displays a subset of the Comic's that satisfy some criterion specified by the user. 
- "As a user, I want to be able to load and save the state of the application" OR "as a user, I wanted to be prompted with the option to load data from file when the application starts and prompted with the option to save data to file when the application ends".  If you go with the first option, you could have buttons or menu items that the user can click when they want to load/save data to/from file.  If you go with the second option, you could have pop-up windows that give the user the option (using Yes/No buttons) to load data when the application starts and to save it when the application ends.

Phase 4 Updates:

Reflections:
  - * As I look back at my project, the design elements and the components that I created. I see a lot that I could've improved upon. On a design level I would have had it so that when I hovered over a comic in the JList I could press the remove or view button from there as an option and made the GUI more interactive and better the way that an actual app these days would work. On a code level there isnâ€™t any changes that I think I could make to make it more efficient without learning more.
